# Macdown-styles
Repo with additional CSS themes for Macdown, not all perfect. Happy to take Pull Requests.

### How to use?
Simple clone this repo into `~/Library/Application Support/Macdown/Styles/`. It won't replace default styles.

### Disclaimer
I do not take credit for these, I've merely made some slight modifications to make it work on Macdown on some of them, but otherwise its just a collection. See CSS for original authors :)
